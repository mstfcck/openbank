# Handling the Concurrency (Draft)
  
## **For Business People (Non-Technical Explanation)**

Imagine a stock trading system where many people are trying to buy shares of a company at the same time. Let’s say there are  **100 shares available**, and you want to buy  **10 shares**. At the same moment, hundreds or thousands of others are also placing orders.

To prevent  **overselling**  (selling more shares than are available), the system needs to be  **very smart and fast**. Here's how we ensure your order is handled correctly:

1. **Reservation System**: When you place an order, the system temporarily "reserves" those 10 shares for you before finalizing the transaction. This prevents others from grabbing them while your order is being processed.

2. **First Come, First Served**: The system processes requests in the order they arrive. It uses a queue to make sure earlier requests are handled before later ones.

3. **Concurrency Control**: Even though many requests come in at the same time, the system has rules to make sure only one request can update the available shares at a time. Think of it like a bank vault—only one person can access it at a time to avoid mistakes.

4. **High-Speed Processing**: The system is built to handle  **millions of transactions per second**  using powerful servers and smart software design. This ensures speed and accuracy.

So, even if thousands of people are trying to buy shares at the same time, the system ensures that  **no more than 100 shares are sold**, and your order is processed fairly and correctly.

## **For Technical People (Technical Explanation)**

Handling 5 million concurrent transactions in a banking API, especially for stock trading, requires robust  **concurrency control**,  **transaction isolation**, and  **scalable architecture**. Here's how we approach it:

### 1. **Concurrency Control**

- Use  **optimistic or pessimistic locking**  depending on the latency tolerance and contention level.
- For high-frequency trading,  **optimistic locking**  with versioning (e.g., using a  `version`  field in DB rows) can reduce contention.
- For critical sections like share availability,  **atomic operations**  or  **distributed locks**  (e.g., Redis RedLock) ensure consistency.

### 2.  **Isolation & Transactions**

- Implement  **ACID-compliant transactions**  at the database level.
- Use  **serializable isolation**  for operations that modify share counts to prevent race conditions.
- Alternatively, use  **event sourcing**  and  **CQRS**  to separate read/write models and replay events for consistency.

### 3.  **Multithreading & Parallelism**

- Use  **thread pools**  and  **async processing**  (e.g., reactive programming with Project Reactor or RxJava) to handle high throughput.
- Employ  **message queues**  (Kafka, RabbitMQ) to decouple order intake from processing, allowing horizontal scaling.

### 4.  **Inventory Management**

- Maintain a  **centralized or distributed in-memory cache**  (e.g., Redis) for real-time share availability.
- Use **atomic decrement operations** to ensure no overselling:

    if available_shares >= requested_shares:
        available_shares -= requested_shares
    else:
        reject_order()

### 5.  **Scalability**

- Deploy services using  **microservices architecture**  with  **horizontal scaling**  via Kubernetes.
- Use  **load balancers**  and  **API gateways**  to distribute traffic efficiently.

### 6.  **Monitoring & Failover**

- Implement  **real-time monitoring**  (Prometheus + Grafana) and  **circuit breakers**  (e.g., Hystrix) to handle failures gracefully.

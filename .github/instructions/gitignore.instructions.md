# MCP .gitignore Instructions

This document outlines the `.gitignore` file for MCP applications. It serves as a guide for developers to ensure that unnecessary files are excluded from version control.

Create or update the `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your MCP application based on the developer's needs and the specific files and directories that should be ignored.

# Spring Architecture Decision Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidance for making architectural decisions in Spring applications.

## Architecture Pattern Selection

### Monolithic Architecture

**CHOOSE** when:
- Small to medium-sized teams (2-8 developers)
- Simple business domain
- Rapid prototyping or MVP development
- Limited operational complexity requirements
- Single database and simple integrations

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- Use Spring Boot with embedded server
- Implement modular package structure by domain
- Use Spring profiles for environment-specific configurations
- Apply layered architecture (Web → Service → Repository → Domain)

### Microservices Architecture

**CHOOSE** when:
- Large development teams (multiple teams)
- Complex business domains with clear boundaries
- Need for independent deployment and scaling
- Different technology requirements per service
- High availability and fault tolerance requirements

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- Each service MUST have its own database
- Use Spring Cloud for service discovery and configuration
- Implement Circuit Breaker pattern with Resilience4j
- Use API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
- Implement distributed tracing with Sleuth/Zipkin
- Use message queues for async communication

### Cloud-Native Architecture

**CHOOSE** when:
- Deploying to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Need for auto-scaling and serverless capabilities
- Container-based deployment strategy
- DevOps and CI/CD pipeline requirements

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- Use Spring Boot with externalized configuration
- Implement health checks and metrics endpoints
- Use Spring Cloud for cloud platform integration
- Follow 12-factor app principles
- Implement graceful shutdown and startup
- Use environment-specific property files

## Layered Architecture Guidelines

### Presentation Layer (Controllers)

**MUST**:
- Handle HTTP requests and responses only
- Validate input using Bean Validation (@Valid)
- Return appropriate DTOs, never domain entities
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement proper exception handling

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/users")
@Validated
public class UserController {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Service Layer

**MUST**:
- Contain business logic and orchestration
- Be transaction boundaries (@Transactional)
- Validate business rules
- Coordinate between multiple repositories
- Handle business exceptions

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class UserService {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Repository Layer

**MUST**:
- Handle data access only
- Use Spring Data JPA interfaces
- Implement custom queries when needed
- Never contain business logic

```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Domain Layer

**MUST**:
- Contain core business entities
- Be framework-independent
- Include domain logic and invariants
- Use proper encapsulation

## Integration Patterns

### Database Integration

**SINGLE DATABASE** (Monolith):
- Use Spring Data JPA with single DataSource
- Implement database migrations with Flyway
- Use connection pooling (HikariCP)

**MULTIPLE DATABASES** (Microservices):
- Configure multiple DataSources
- Use database-per-service pattern
- Implement eventual consistency patterns
- Use Saga pattern for distributed transactions

### External API Integration

**SYNCHRONOUS**:
- Use Spring WebClient for reactive calls
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use proper timeout configurations

**ASYNCHRONOUS**:
- Use Spring RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka
- Implement message deduplication
- Handle dead letter queues
- Use proper serialization formats

## Decision Matrix

| Requirement | Monolith | Microservices | Cloud-Native |
|-------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Team Size | 2-8 | 8+ | Any |
| Complexity | Low-Medium | High | Medium-High |
| Scalability | Vertical | Horizontal | Auto-scaling |
| Deployment | Single | Independent | Container-based |
| Monitoring | Simple | Complex | Platform-integrated |
| Development Speed | Fast | Slow initial | Medium |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**DON'T**:
- Create distributed monoliths
- Share databases across microservices
- Ignore transaction boundaries
- Over-engineer simple solutions
- Mix synchronous and asynchronous patterns without clear reasoning

**ENSURE**:
- Clear service boundaries
- Proper error handling strategies
- Consistent data patterns
- Appropriate testing strategies for chosen architecture

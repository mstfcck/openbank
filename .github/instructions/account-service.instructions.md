# Account Service Instructions

- Ensure that the account service is designed to handle account-related operations such as creating, updating, and retrieving account information.
- Ensure that the account service is modular, with a clear separation of concerns between controllers, services, repositories, and models.
- Ensure that the account service is designed for easy integration with other microservices, such as user service and transaction service.

- Implement a RESTful API for the account service, allowing clients to interact with account data.
- Implement unit tests for the account service to ensure that the functionality is working as expected.
- Implement security measures to protect sensitive account information, such as using Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Ensure that the account service is designed to be stateless, allowing it to scale horizontally without issues.
- Use Spring Boot's built-in features for configuration management, allowing the account service to be easily configured for different environments (development, testing, production).
- Implement a database schema for the account service, ensuring that it can store account information efficiently.
- Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for the account service, ensuring that it can handle complex queries and relationships between entities.
- Implement database migrations using tools like Flyway or Liquibase to manage schema changes over time.
- Ensure that the account service is designed to handle high availability and fault tolerance, allowing it to recover gracefully from failures.
- Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., using Redis) to improve performance for frequently accessed account data.
- Ensure that the account service is designed to be easily testable, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces that allow for easy mocking and testing.
